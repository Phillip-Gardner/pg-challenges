# Typosquatting

Given a list of domains, figure out whether there is typosquats.

You will be given a list of home domains, and a list of new domains scraped from the web.

They will be in the format domain.host

If the domain is the same, check if the host is the same. If it's not, return it. It's a typosquat.
