# Ask me nicely!

As the nicer sibling, you are always being asked to do things and you are fed up by not being asked nicely.

In this challenge, you will be given a question in the form of a string.

If the question doesn't end in a question mark, you should respond 'That's not a question'

If the question doesn't end in 'please', you should respond 'Ask me nicely!'

If the question ends in 'please?', you should respond 'Sure Thang!'
